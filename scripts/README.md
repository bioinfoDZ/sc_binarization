# Single-Cell Data Binarization and Integration

This folder contains scripts for single-cell data binarization, integration, and analysis across multiple modalities. The project implements several methods for multimodal data integration and factor analysis.

## Folder Structure


    simulation/: Scripts for generating synthetic single-cell multi-modal data
    scbfa/: Single-Cell Bayesian Factor Analysis implementation
    muon/: Muon-based integration of multi-modal data
    momat/: scMOMAT integration methods
    multigrate/: Multi-omic integration with modality-specific signal preservation
    ambiguous_cluster_improvement/: Tools for identifying and analyzing intermediate cell states
